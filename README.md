"There are flowers, In my heart. They're growin' thorns, And it hurts." {Blondie - Current Joys}

"I have nightmares, I have nightmares, I have nightmares all the time. So I stay awake, So I stay awake, So I stay awake all night. I say I'm gonna leave, I say I'm gonna leave, I say I'm gonna leave, but I think you're right. I'm gonna stay right here, I'm gonna stay right here, I'm gonna stay right here until I die. Till I die, Till I die. It's DIY, It's DIY." {New Flesh - Current Joys}

"Now I'll never, never, never, never, never, never, See you again. And cry, Oh, I want you to cry. For what you did to me, On that night. 'Cause I'm scared, God, I'm terrified. What would happen, To my life?" {You Broke My Heart - Current Joys}

"But I don't want to be afraid, I don't want to live this way, I don't want you to leave." {Fear - Current Joys}

"Give me everything I ever need, Or just enough so I can go to sleep. Well, is it me or is it you who came to see?" {Become the Warm Jets - Current Joys}
